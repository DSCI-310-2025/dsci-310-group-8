    "\n",
    "The dataset selected for this project is the **Adult Dataset** (Kohavi & Becker, 1996), available through the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It contains demographic and income data collected by the **U.S. Census Bureau** and is widely used for predicting whether an individualâ€™s income exceeds **$50,000 per year** based on various demographic factors.\n",

    "- **Dataset Name**: UC Irvine Adult Dataset  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Age**: Ranges from 17 to 90, with an average age of 38.6 years.\n",
    "- **Education-num**: Has values from 1 to 16, representing various education levels.\n",
    "- **Capital-gain**: Ranges from 0 to 99,999, with most values concentrated around zero, indicating that high capital gains are rare.\n",
    "- **Capital-loss**: Similar to capital gain, most values are zero.\n",
    "- **Hours-per-week**: Has a mean of 40.4 hours, aligning with typical full-time work expectations.\n",
    "- **Income**: Target variable, classified into two categories: <=50K and >50K. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes both **categorical** and **numerical** variables, making it suitable for analyzing relationships between **demographic attributes** and **income levels**. Further **exploration and preprocessing** may involve handling **missing values** and **encoding categorical features**.  \n",

    "### Research Question  \n",
    "**How do demographic factors influence the likelihood of an individual's annual income exceeding $50,000?**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study explores relationships between demographic variables and income levels without pre-assuming key predictors. Our team initially analyzed different aspects of the dataset before deciding to focus on demographic influences on income.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Literature Context  \n",
    "Prior research supports the importance of demographic factors in income prediction. Jo (2023) analyzed the **Adult dataset** and identified **capital gain, education, relationship status, and occupation** as key predictors. Similarly, Azzollini et al. (2023) found that demographic differences explained **40% of income inequality** across OECD countries, reinforcing the relevance of our analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question encompasses both **prediction** and **inference**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prediction:** To develop a model capable of predicting the likelihood of an individual earning more than $50,000 annually based on key demographic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inference:** To understand the nature and strength of the relationships between various demographic factors and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading Required Libraries\n",
    "We will start by importing the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and preprocessing."
