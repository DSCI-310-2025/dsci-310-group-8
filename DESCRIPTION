Description: 
  This project uses the UCI Adult Census dataset to predict whether an individual earns 
  more than $50K annually using logistic regression. The analysis includes data 
  preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. 
  The project emphasizes reproducible workflows using GNU Make, Quarto, testthat, and Docker, 
  and includes well-documented functions and test suites to ensure software reliability.
